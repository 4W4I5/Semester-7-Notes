# Parallel vs Distributed Computing
- **Parallel**
	- Requires at least 1+ processors
	- Must have a way to sync processors and cores
	- Only the processors and cores within the computer share the memory
- **Distributed**
	- Networked/Clustered computers
	- Requires media i.e. a connection is required be it a wired or wireless one.
	- Follows Master/Slave model via MPI
	- Memory is shared in cluster

### Communication Media
- **Buses**
	- Hardware
- **Message Passing (MPI)**
	- Software based
