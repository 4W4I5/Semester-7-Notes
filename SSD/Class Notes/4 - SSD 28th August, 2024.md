## Todayâ€™s Agenda
1. Security Requirements and Design Principles (Continued)
2. OWASP Guidelines for Secure Software Design at the Use Case Level (Continued)

## Security Design Principles (Continued)

### 8. Careful Management of Authority Changes
- **Guideline**: Proper management of changes in authority in local memories is crucial to maintain security.
- **Key Points**:
  - Every access must be checked against the access control mechanism.
  - Systems should not rely on cached access decisions.
  - Example: Whenever a file is read, a database must exercise access control to ensure the user has the necessary permissions.

### 9. Transparency to Users
- **Guideline**: Security mechanisms should be transparent to users and provide minimal obstructions.
- **Key Points**:
  - If security measures do not make sense to the user, they are likely to make errors or attempt to bypass them.
  - Security should not interfere unduly with authorized access.
  - Example: Modern operating systems provide isolated process spaces to protect individual users' files and processes.

### 10. No Physical Connection
- **Guideline**: There should be no physical connection between processes or files of different users.
- **Key Points**:
  - Processes should be isolated, and users should not share physical resources.
  - Example: Public access systems should be isolated from critical systems to prevent unauthorized access.

### 11. Encapsulation
- **Guideline**: Encapsulation is essential to protect the internal structure of data objects.
- **Key Points**:
  - Encapsulation involves wrapping data objects and procedures in a domain, making them accessible only through defined interfaces.
  - This approach helps protect sensitive data and maintain security boundaries within software systems.

### 12. Modularity
- **Guideline**: Security mechanisms should be modular and support the migration to new features without requiring a complete redesign.
- **Key Points**:
  - A modular architecture allows for the separation and protection of different security modules.
  - It facilitates the integration of upgraded security features, ensuring continuous security without disrupting existing systems.

### 13. Defense in Depth
- **Guideline**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to provide redundancy in case one control fails.
- **Key Points**:
  - The failure of one security mechanism should not compromise the entire system.
  - Employing various protection strategies ensures that security breaches are contained and mitigated.

### 14. User Intuition Alignment
- **Guideline**: Authorization mechanisms should be intuitive and align with user expectations.
- **Key Points**:
  - Users should understand how security goals map to the provided security mechanisms.
  - The user interface should be designed to minimize confusion and ensure that users follow security best practices.

## OWASP Guidelines for Secure Software Design at the Use Case Level (Continued)

### 11. Secure Software Update Mechanisms (Continued)
- **Guideline**: Ensure secure distribution and application of software updates.
- **Use Case**: When providing patches or updates to users.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Sign software updates with a cryptographic signature to verify their authenticity.
  - Use secure channels for distributing updates (e.g., HTTPS).
  - Implement automatic updates with user consent to ensure that critical patches are applied promptly.
  - Validate update integrity before applying to prevent tampering.

### 12. Handling Sensitive Data
- **Guideline**: Protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.
- **Use Case**: When processing, storing, or transmitting sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, personal data).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Minimize the storage and exposure of sensitive data; only collect what is necessary.
  - Use strong encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Apply data masking or tokenization to reduce the risk of exposure in non-production environments.
  - Implement strong access controls to restrict who can view or modify sensitive data.

### 13. Secure Configuration Management
- **Guideline**: Maintain secure configuration settings across all environments.
- **Use Case**: When deploying and managing software in production.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Follow the principle of least privilege for all configuration settings.
  - Disable or remove unnecessary features, services, or components.
  - Regularly review and update configurations to align with the latest security best practices.
  - Monitor for and remediate configuration drift to maintain security baselines.

### 14. Logging and Monitoring
- **Guideline**: Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Use Case**: When tracking application activity and responding to potential security breaches.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Log all security-relevant events, including login attempts, changes to sensitive data, and access to critical resources.
  - Protect logs from tampering and unauthorized access.
  - Implement real-time monitoring and alerting to detect unusual behavior.
  - Regularly review and analyze logs to identify potential security issues.

### 15. Third-Party Components
- **Guideline**: Manage third-party components to minimize risks.
- **Use Case**: When using libraries, frameworks, or other third-party software components.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Regularly update third-party components to their latest versions.
  - Monitor for and address any vulnerabilities reported in third-party components.
  - Prefer well-maintained and widely used libraries to reduce the risk of using vulnerable or unsupported code.
  - Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage third-party risks.

### 16. Mobile Application Security
- **Guideline**: Ensure mobile applications follow secure coding practices.
- **Use Case**: When developing or maintaining mobile apps.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data (e.g., Keychain, Keystore).
  - Implement strong authentication and session management tailored for mobile environments.
  - Secure communications using TLS and avoid relying on client-side security checks.
  - Regularly review and update mobile app security practices to address emerging threats.

### 17. Secure Deployment
- **Guideline**: Deploy software securely by following best practices.
- **Use Case**: When deploying software to production environments.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Automate deployment processes to reduce human error and improve consistency.
  - Use environment-specific configurations to minimize exposure in production.
  - Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing) before deployment.
  - Monitor deployment processes for any signs of compromise.

### 18. Security Awareness and Training
- **Guideline**: Ensure all team members are aware of security best practices.
- **Use Case**: When onboarding new developers or regularly training existing staff.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Provide ongoing security training for developers, testers, and operations staff.
  - Promote a security-first mindset within the organization.
  - Keep teams updated on the latest security threats and mitigation strategies.
  - Encourage the adoption of secure coding practices across all stages of development.

### 19. Continuous Security Testing
- **Guideline**: Regularly test and validate security controls.
- **Use Case**: Throughout the software development and deployment lifecycle.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with integrated security testing.
  - Perform regular security assessments, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing.
  - Automate security testing to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - Remediate identified vulnerabilities promptly and retest to ensure fixes are effective.

### 20. Secure Software Lifecycle Management
- **Guideline**: Integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- **Use Case**: Across all phases of software development, from planning to decommissioning.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Include security requirements during the planning and design phases.
  - Perform threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security risks early.
  - Integrate security checks and balances at each phase of the SDLC.
  - Continuously monitor and improve security practices throughout the software lifecycle.
