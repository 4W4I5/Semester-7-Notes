| **Purpose**              | Centralized authentication and authorization for remote access, network devices, and wireless networks. | The advanced version of RADIUS is used for AAA in IP-based networks, especially 3G and LTE networks. | Centralized AAA, is typically used in network devices (Cisco).                 | Secure authentication for user sessions in a centralized environment (SSO). |
| **Protocol Type**        | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)                                                                            | TCP/SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)                                                      | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)                                            | Symmetric Key Cryptography (with a trusted third party for tickets)         |
| **Encryption**           | Only passwords are encrypted                                                                            | Encrypts full packets                                                                                | Encrypts the entire payload                                                    | Uses cryptographic tickets and session keys for authentication              |
| **Authentication**       | Single-step authentication is often used for 802.1x, VPNs, and dial-up.                                 | Multi-step authentication offers better scalability and reliability than RADIUS.                     | Handles separate authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. | Ticket-based authentication with Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality         |
| **Transport Protocol**   | UDP                                                                                                     | TCP/SCTP                                                                                             | TCP                                                                            | None (uses tickets and secret keys)                                         |
| **Vendor**               | Open, widely supported                                                                                  | Evolved from RADIUS, 3GPP standard                                                                   | Cisco proprietary                                                              | MIT-developed, often used in Microsoft Active Directory                     |
| **Performance**          | Lightweight, lower reliability due to UDP.                                                              | More reliable and scalable than RADIUS.                                                              | High reliability due to the use of TCP.                                        | High security, built for strong, centralized environments                   |

# Chapter 8: Cryptography
## Introduction
- **Cryptology** -> Science of Encryption, includes Cryptography & Cryptanalysis
		- **Cryptography** -> Making and using code to secure messages
		- **Cryptanalysis** -> Cracking or breaking Encrypted messages back into their unencrypted form
	- ~~Foundations of Cryptology (Skipped, nothing to note)~~
- **Terminology**
	- **Algorithm** -> A set of rules or steps designed to perform a specific task, such as encryption or decryption.
	- **Bit stream cipher** -> A cipher that encrypts data one bit at a time, often used for streaming data.
	- **Block cipher** -> A cipher that encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits) for increased security and structure.
	- **Cipher or cryptosystem** -> A method of encryption and decryption to secure information from unauthorized access.
	- **Ciphertext/cryptogram** -> The encrypted output that appears as an unreadable or scrambled format.
	- **Code** -> A method of converting data into a different form, often used to represent data with symbols or keywords for privacy or brevity.
	- **Decipher** -> The process of converting ciphertext back into readable plaintext.
	- **Decrypt** -> The reverse process of encryption, transforming ciphertext into its original plaintext form.
	- **Encipher** -> The process of converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.
	- **Encrypt** -> The process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext to secure information.
	- **Key/Cryptovariable** -> A secret value used in cryptographic algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data.
	- **Keyspace** -> The total number of possible values for a key in a cryptosystem.
	- **Link encryption** -> An encryption method where data is encrypted at each link in a communication chain, including headers and metadata.
	- **Plaintext/cleartext** -> The original, readable data before encryption.
	- **Steganography** -> The practice of hiding messages or information within other non-secret text, images, or media.
	- **Work factor** -> The estimated time and resources required to break a cryptosystem by an attacker.
## Cipher Methods
- **Substitution Cipher**
	- Exchange one value for another
	- Types:
		- Monoalphabetic: Only one alphabet is used
		- Polyalphabetic: Use of two or more alphabets
		- Vigenère: Made up of 26 distinct cipher alphabets where the letters of a key and the PT are mapped onto a grid to get a new letter
- **Transposition Cipher**
	- Rearrange values within a block to create CT
	- Can be done bitwise or bytewise
- **Exclusive OR (XOR)**
	- Boolean Function
		- If two bits are the same, then output a binary 0
		- If two bits are **not** the same, then output a binary 1
	- Not recommended to be used on its own, very simple to break
- **Vernam Cipher**
	- Developed by AT&T
	- Use a set of characters once per encryption process, makes it hard to perform known ciphertext attacks
	- PadValues are added to PT(converted to numeric values), the sum exists in modulo 26 and is converted into a ciphertext letter
- **Book-Based Ciphers**
	- Uses text in a book to decrypt a message
	- **Book Cipher** -> CT is a list of codes representing page, line & word numbers
	- **Running Key Cipher** -> Uses a book for passing a key to cipher that is similar to vigenere, sender provides encrypted message with sequence of numbers from predetermined book to be used as an indicator block
	- **Template Cipher** -> Involves the use of hidden message in book, letter, or other message; requires page with specific number of holes cut into it. Should've been called a cheese slice cipher.
### Hash Functions
- Mathematical algos to confirm message identity and verify that it has not been changed
- Hash Algos
	- Public functions that create hash value
- Use of keys not required, although a Message Authn Code (MAC) can be attached to the message
- Used mainly in password verification systems to confirm the identity of the user.
## Cryptographic Algorithms
- ### Grouped into
	- #### Symmetric Encryption
		- AKA Same key encryption, both the sender and receiver have the key
		- Implemented via DES, 3DES and AES
	- #### Asymmetric Encryption
		- AKA Public-Key encryption
		- Either key can decrypt/encrypt messages encrypted by the other
		- Implemented first via RSA
- ### Encryption Key Size
	- Theoretical Operations to break an encryption is thought to be 2<sup>k</sup> operations where `k` is the keysize. However it takes half that time in reality on average.
	- Keysize is what determines an Encryption algos strength, the security of the key is not as important
- ### Use of Cryptography
	- Conceal contents of sensitive messages
	- Verify contents of messages and the identities of their senders
	- Must be able to be integrated into everyday world of computing
- ### Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
	- Provides:
		- Authn
		- Auth
		- Integrity
		- Privacy
		- Non-Repudiation
	- Uses:
		- Certificate Authority (CA)
		- Registration Authority (RA)
		- Certificate Directories
		- Management Protocols
		- Polices & Procedures
- ### Digital Sigs
	- Needed to verify sender integrity
	- Follows Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
	- Enforces Non-Repudiation
- ### Digital Certs
	- Issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs)
	- Bind an entity's public key to their identity
	- Contain information such as certificate holder’s name, public key, CA's digital signature, and expiration date
	- Used in SSL/TLS to establish secure connections online
	- Help verify the authenticity of a sender or website, enhancing trust and security
- ### Hybrid Cryptography Systems
	- Asymmetric key encryption not widely used, unless its with digital certs
	- Most common is the Deffie-Hellman Key Exchange:
		- Use of Asymmetric keys to transfer a symmetric key which is then used for transmitting messages
- ### ~~Steganography (Skipped, too simple)~~

- ### Securing EMAIL with S/MIME, PEM and PGP
- ### Securing Web Transactions with SET, SSL, and S-HTTP
- ### Securing Wireless Networks with WEP & WPA
