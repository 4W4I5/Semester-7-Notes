# Chapter 1: Introduction to InfoSec
## What is Information Security?
- Defined by Jim Anderson in 2002 as "a well-informed sense of assurance that information risks and controls are in balance."
- This involves **protecting information** and its critical elements, including the systems that use, store, and transmit it.
- To protect this data, organizations need policies, awareness programs, training, education, and technology.

### Key Concepts:
- **Security**: The state of being free from danger. Security involves multiple layers, including:
    - **Physical security**: Protecting physical assets from unauthorized access.
    - **Personal security**: Protecting individuals and groups.
    - **Operations security**: Securing the processes and activities of an organization.
    - **Communications security**: Protecting communications media and content.
    - **Network security**: Securing the components and connections in networks.
    - **Information security**: Ensuring data is safe from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.

## History of Information Security
### Early Years
- **World War II**: The need for security arose with the first mainframes, used for military and intelligence purposes.
    - Early controls were mostly **physical**, such as **badges**, **keys**, and **facial recognition**.
    - **Information security** at the time involved rudimentary methods, like document classification, with little focus on system security.

### 1960s
- The **Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA)** initiated research to develop a **redundant, networked communications system**. This was the origin of **ARPANET**, the precursor to the Internet.
- **Larry Roberts**, who developed ARPANET, is known as the **founder of the Internet**.

### 1970s & 1980s
- As ARPANET grew, so did **security issues**, especially with dial-up access:
    - No **user identification** or **authorization**.
    - Phone numbers for ARPANET were publicly shared, allowing unauthorized access.
- The development of the **MULTICS** system (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) focused on **security** from the start, introducing **multiple security levels** and **passwords**.
- In the **late 1970s**, **Rand Report R-609** was the first paper to define **computer security**, shifting the focus from just **physical security** to include the **safety of data** and **access controls**.

### 1990s to Present
- As **networks of computers** became common, so did the **need to secure interconnected systems**.
- The **Internet**, a global network, expanded, but **security was a low priority** in its early deployments.
- The interconnected nature of systems today means that the **security of each computer** is dependent on the **security of every connected system**.

## Key Information Security Concepts
- **Access**: The ability to use or manipulate a system or data.
- **Asset**: Resources being protected, like hardware, software, data, or information.
- **Attack**: An attempt to damage or compromise information systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.
- **Control/Safeguard**: Mechanisms, policies, or procedures that counter threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit**: Taking advantage of a weakness or vulnerability.
- **Risk**: The probability of loss or damage.
- **Threat**: Any potential danger to an asset (e.g., hackers, malware).
- **Vulnerability**: Weaknesses in a system that can be exploited.

### Computers as Subjects or Objects of Attack
- A computer can be both the **subject** (used as a tool to attack another system) and the **object** (the target of the attack) of an attack.

## Critical Characteristics of Information
The value of information comes from the following key characteristics:
1. **Availability**: Information should be available to authorized users when needed and in the required format.
2. **Accuracy**: Data should be free from errors and reflect what the user expects.
3. **Authenticity**: Information should be genuine and original, not fabricated.
4. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
5. **Integrity**: Information should be complete and uncorrupted.
6. **Utility**: Information should serve its intended purpose.
7. **Possession**: The state of having control or ownership of information.

## The Security Systems Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC)
The **SecSDLC** is a structured methodology for implementing information security, adapted from the traditional Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Phases of SecSDLC:
1. **Investigation**:
    - Identifies the problem the system is being developed to solve.
    - Specifies project objectives, scope, and constraints.
    - **Feasibility analysis**: Assesses whether the project is economically, technically, and behaviorally feasible.
2. **Analysis**:
    - Involves assessing the organization, current systems, and their capabilities.
    - Analysts document findings and update feasibility analyses.
3. **Logical Design**:
    - Based on the analysis, select applications and technologies that will meet business needs.
    - Data structures are chosen to support the system, followed by another feasibility analysis.
4. **Physical Design**:
    - Specific technologies are selected to support the logical design.
    - Components are evaluated based on a **make-or-buy** decision (whether to develop in-house or purchase).
    - Final design is presented to end-users for approval.
5. **Implementation**:
    - Software is created or purchased, components are tested, and users are trained.
    - **Feasibility analysis** is conducted, and the system is reviewed by users.
6. **Maintenance and Change**:
    - This phase is the **longest and most expensive**. It involves ongoing support and modification of the system.
    - **Threats evolve**, and the system must constantly adapt to new risks.

## Security Professionals and the Organization
### Key Roles:
- **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**: The senior technology officer responsible for advising on strategic planning related to information management.
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Oversees the assessment, management, and implementation of information security within the organization.

### Information Security Project Team:
- **Champion**: A senior executive who supports the project financially and administratively.
- **Team Leader**: A project manager who understands both project management and technical security requirements.
- **Security Policy Developers**: Experts in developing organizational security policies.
- **Risk Assessment Specialists**: Understand financial risk and security methods.
- **Security Professionals**: Specialists with deep knowledge in various areas of information security.
- **Systems Administrators**: Manage and maintain systems that house critical information.
- **End Users**: Individuals who interact with the system and provide feedback on security measures.

## Data Responsibilities
- **Data Owner**: Responsible for the security and use of a particular set of information. They define data classification levels.
- **Data Custodian**: Manages data storage, maintenance, and backup procedures.
- **Data Users**: Individuals who work with information as part of their daily responsibilities.

## Approaches to Security Implementation
### Bottom-Up Approach:
- **Grassroots** effort, typically initiated by **systems administrators**.
- **Advantage**: Technical expertise of the individuals implementing the security.
- **Disadvantage**: Often lacks organizational support and staying power, making it less successful.

### Top-Down Approach:
- **Initiated by upper management**, with clear goals, policies, and accountability.
- Supported by **dedicated resources** and a formal development strategy like the SecSDLC.
- This approach has **higher success rates** due to **management backing**.

## Security as an Art, Science, and Social Science
### Security as an Art:
- **No hard and fast rules** for implementing security across systems.
- Security relies on individual expertise and interpretation, especially in complex environments.

### Security as a Science:
- Technology operates based on well-defined principles and interactions.
- Nearly all **system failures** and **security vulnerabilities** can be traced to specific causes within hardware or software.
- Given enough time, most faults could be **resolved by developers**.

### Security as a Social Science:
- Focuses on **human behavior** and how people interact with systems.
- End-users are often the **weakest link** in security.
- **Security administrators** can reduce risks by understanding behavioral factors and implementing **user-friendly controls**.
