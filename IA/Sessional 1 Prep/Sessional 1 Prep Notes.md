# Chapter 1: Introduction to InfoSec
## What is Information Security?
- "A well-informed sense of assurance that information risks and controls are balanced." â€” _Jim Anderson, Inovant (2002)_
- **Computer security** evolved from protecting physical systems to securing digital information.

## History of Information Security
- **World War II**: First mainframes developed for code-breaking.
- **1960s**: ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, highlighted the need for secured communications.
- **1970s & 80s**:
    - Increased threats as ARPANET grew.
    - The **Rand Report R-609** began formal study of computer security.
    - Shifted from physical security to data protection and access control.

## Key Terms
- **Asset**: Resource being protected.
- **Attack**: Intentional or unintentional attempt to damage a system.
- **Exploit**: Taking advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability**: A flaw in the system that can be attacked.

## Critical Characteristics of Information
1. **Availability**: Accessible when needed.
2. **Accuracy**: Free from errors.
3. **Authenticity**: Genuine, not a reproduction.
4. **Confidentiality**: Protected from unauthorized access.
5. **Integrity**: Complete and uncorrupted.
6. **Utility**: Useful to the user.
7. **Possession**: Control or ownership of the information.

## The CIA Triangle
- **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** were the standard for security.
- Now expanded to include the critical characteristics above.

## Security Models
- **CNSS Security Model** (also known as the **McCumber Cube**):
    - Combines Information States (Storage, Processing, Transmission), Security Goals (CIA), and Security Measures (Policy, Education, Technology).

## The Security Systems Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC)
1. **Investigation**: Define objectives, scope, and feasibility.
2. **Analysis**: Assess current security and identify threats.
3. **Logical Design**: Plan policies and response actions.
4. **Physical Design**: Select specific security technologies.
5. **Implementation**: Install and test security measures.
6. **Maintenance and Change**: Ongoing system support and modification.

## Information Security as a Discipline
- **Art**: No universal rules, influenced by individual interpretation.
- **Science**: Structured approach with known cause-effect relationships.
- **Social Science**: Focus on the behavior of people interacting with systems.

## Key Roles in Information Security
- **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**: Strategic planning of information management.
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Implementation and management of security.
- **Security Project Team**: Includes security professionals, systems administrators, and end-users.
